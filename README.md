I'm a veteran Full StackOverflow Developer & Architect from the Land Down Under.

[17 Jan 2022] I have made private some public repositories because I'm now being spammed on my GitHub email.  
I don't have the time or desire to deal with this crap.

I build software with:

- C#, .NET
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- VueJS
- SQL Server
- Azure
